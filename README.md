# libasm - Assembly yourself!

## Some notes about project

This project was completed and handed over on 03/04/2020 (and was one of my study projects), but for some reason it was uploaded to the github only now.

The project was intended to learn how to write the simplest functions in assembler, to get to know more about the work of the processor.

## Project describe

The library with list of functions rewrited on assembler (used the Intel syntax, code set the variable errno properly).

Rewrited the following functions:

> ◦ ft_strlen

> ◦ ft_strcpy

> ◦ ft_strcmp

> ◦ ft_write

> ◦ ft_read

> ◦ ft_strdup


## How to test library

To test library just use "make" command in accroding directory, after compiling launch file named "test". You can use your own main.
